# How I Became a Full-Stack Developer from a Non-CS Background

Switching to web development without a Computer Science degree might seem intimidating, but it’s completely possible! Here’s my journey from a non-CS background to becoming a **Full-Stack Developer** specializing in the **MERN stack**.



## 🚀 Getting Started with Web Development
I started with **basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, building small projects like:
- A **To-Do List App** (to learn React)
- A **Movie App** (using TMDB API)
- A **User Management System** (with MongoDB, Express & EJS)

## 🔥 Mastering Frontend with React & Redux
Once I got comfortable, I **deep-dived into React.js**, learning:
- Component-based architecture
- State management with Redux
- API handling & routing with React Router

## 🛠 Learning Backend with Node.js & Express
To become a full-stack developer, I learned:
- **REST APIs** using Express
- **MongoDB** for database management
- **Socket.io** for real-time chat apps

## 🎯 Real-World Experience & Projects
I gained hands-on experience by building projects like:
- **AI-Powered Code Reviewer (MERN + Google Gemini API)**
- **Collaborative Learning Platform (Subscription-based)**
- **Interactive Xbox Website (Three.js + GSAP)**

## 🏆 Participating in Hackathons
Hackathons boosted my learning! I competed in **REIMAGINE Hackathon**, where I:
- **Redesigned NIKE’s website** (using GSAP animations)
- **Built an interactive Xbox site** (with 3D models in Three.js)
- **Secured 4th place among many talented developers**

## 📚 Continuous Learning & Next Goals
- **Mastering GSAP & Framer Motion** for animations
- **Building an Animated Library for Developers**
- **Exploring React Native for Mobile App Development**

## 💡 Key Takeaways
✅ **Consistency & Practice Matter** – Small projects add up!  
✅ **Real Projects > Just Tutorials** – Build & deploy real apps.  
✅ **Community & Networking** – LinkedIn & Hackathons helped a lot.  

## 🚀 Final Thoughts
If you’re from a non-CS background, **don’t let that hold you back!** Start small, stay consistent, and focus on real-world projects. Success in tech is all about **problem-solving, passion, and perseverance**.
